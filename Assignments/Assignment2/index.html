                Pick me up and turn me round<br>
                I feel numb, born with a weak heart<br>
                I guess I must be having fun<br>
                The less we say about it, the better<br>
                Make it up as we go along<br>
                Feet on the ground, head in the sky<br>
                It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing</p><br><br>

                But I guess I'm already there<br>
                I come home, she lifted up her wings<br>
                I guess that this must be the place<br>
                I can't tell one from the other<br>
                Did I find you or you find me?<br>
                There was a time before we were born<br>

                Out of all those kinds of people<br>
                You got a face with a view<br>
                I'm just an animal looking for a home<br>
                Share the same space for a minute or two<br>
                And you love me 'til my heart stops<br>
                Love me 'til I'm dead<br>

            <br>
            <div class="a">
                <p1><em>"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)"</em> is a <br> 
                    song by new wave band Talking Heads,<br> released in November 1983 as the second <br> 
                    single from their fifth album Speaking in <br> 
                    Tongues. The lyrics were written by David <br> 
                    Byrne, and the music was written by Byrne <br> 
                    and the other members of the band, Chris <br>
                    Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry <br>
                    Harrison.</p1> <br> <br>
           
                <p1>In the "Self Interview" on the DVD of the <br>
                    concert film Stop Making Sense, Byrne <br>
                    states that it is a love song, a topic he <br>
                    tends to avoid because it is "kinda big." He <br>
                    also said of the song:</p1> <br> <br>
            
            <div class="b">
                    <blockquote>That's a love song made up almost <br>
                    completely of non sequiturs, <br>
                    phrases that may have a strong <br> 
                    emotional resonance but don't <br> 
                    have any narrative qualities. It's a <br> 
                    real honest kind of love song. I <br> 
                    don't think I've ever done a real <br> 
                    love song before. Mine always had <br> 
                    a sort of reservation, or a twist. I <br> 
                    tried to write one that wasn't <br> 
                    corny, that didn't sound stupid or <br> 
                    lame the way many do. I think I <br> 
                    succeeded; I was pretty happy <br> 
                    with that.<sup><a href="#cite1">[1]</a></sup></blockquote></div>
